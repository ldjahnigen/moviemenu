moviemenu by Louis Jahnigen

This is a simple program that takes a directory of movies and their associated posters and displays them
on an accessible interface. The purpose of this program is to make browsing for downloaded movies
on VLC Media Player more convenient. 

note: I am not in any way associated with VLC Media, I do not own the software and have not contributed to it.
This program simply calls VLC Media player and does not edit it or repackage it in any way.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. move mmconfig.txt to ~/.config
2. enter the paths to your movie and poster directories
3. move "moviemenuruntime" to ~/bin 
4. copy "moviemenu.desktop" to ~/.local/share/applications
5. use dmenu or your launch interface
